    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I’m a friendly guy who loves coffee, coding and learning.</p>
    <p>
      I began website development in the late 1990s, working with the HTML, CSS
      and JavaScript front-end development tools, coding techniques and
      development practices were built upon through study at the University of
      Wollongong.
    </p>
    <p>
      During a Computer Engineering cadet-ship I commenced in 2001 with
      BHP/BlueScope Steel, I began working with back-end systems and languages
      including perl, PHP, ASP as well as the SQL relational database language.
      Building Intranet monitoring and reporting applications for several
      internal departments were some of my key responsibilities, in addition to
      experience programming lower-level PLCs, DCSs and Level-3 production line
      plant and control systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      From BlueScope Steel, I moved onto external facing website and
      applications, developing primarily in the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL
      and PHP). Implementing solutions using popular web applications such as
      WordPress and Drupal for various clients.
    </p>
    <p>
      I joined Wisdom as a Web Developer in September 2012, bringing a broad
      technical knowledge of the full-stack of web technologies, gained from 13
      years in the industry. I have experience building, testing, launching and
      supporting Tourism, E-commerce and custom CMS websites as well as
      application development for Apple iOS, Google Android and Microsoft
      Windows systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      My front-end skills include best practices for HTML, CSS and advanced
      JavaScript to build fast and dynamic user interfaces and solid experience
      with industry standard Back-end technologies in the LAMP stack – Linux,
      Apache, MySQL and PHP.
